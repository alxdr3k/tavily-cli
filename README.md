```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly:

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Usage

## File Storage

Search results are saved in the `search_results` directory as JSON files with timestamps:

```
search_results/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 20251015-120145_python-programming-tutorials.json
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 20251015-120302_machine-learning-frameworks.json
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each file contains:
- The original query
- The timestamp when the search was performed
- The complete search results from Tavily
